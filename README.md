# Singlebrook Technology Web Fonts

## Singlebrook Regular
The regular Singlebrook typeface for use on the Intranet & Public website is Singlebrook Regular.  Its filename is singlebrook-webfont.ext.

The .woff, .ttf, .svg, and .eot variations are necessary for cross-browser @font-face declarations.

The .fog file is the Fontographer file used to create the font.  This is the one that should be edited if the font ever needs to be updated.  You can then generate the .ttf file through Fontographer, and then use FontPrep (fontprep.com, $5, or use this serial number: (tbd)) to export the necessary other file types you need.

This will eventually become a sub-module so that updates will easily be sent to any site using this font.

The method for creating the necessary file variations is the same as above.
